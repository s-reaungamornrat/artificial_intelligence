# Artificial Intelligence

A repository contains projects developed for the [Udacity AI NanoDegree program](!https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898). The code was written in python ansd the projects involve both logic based and machine learning approaches.

# Getting Started

The code is based on python 3.6, tensorflow, and keras. We recommend to create a new conda environment using the [following command](!https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands)
```
conda create --name your_env_name
```
where `your_env_name` is the name of your conda environment. To activate the environment,
for *Windows*, use
```
activate your_env_name
```
for *Linux*, use
```
source activate your_env_name
